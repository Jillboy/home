/**
 * To retrieve information about your followed streamers from Twitch
 * API, you'll need to register your own Twitch application. More
 * information on how to do that here:
 *   "https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/guides/using-the-twitch-api/"
 * From there you can get your client ID. You'll also need an OAuth
 * access token, with a "user_read" scope so you can get the list of
 * streamers you follow from the API. More information on how to get
 * one here:
 *   "https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/guides/authentication/"
 * Once you have your client ID and an OAuth token, replace the
 * placeholders YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN below by their
 * actual values, resave this file as "keys.json" and it should work
 * out of the box.
 *
 * Note: Your OAuth access token must be kept secret! Don't upload it
 * anywhere where other people can see them. By default, this project
 * contains a rule in its ".gitignore" to ignore any file called
 * "keys.json", so you can push this project to GitHub without having
 * other people see the values of your API keys.
